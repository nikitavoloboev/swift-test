Example repo that is failing to get selected text working on macOS 15.0

Can open project in Xcode, run it. Press `command+.` on some selected text and should be able to see the selected text in Xcode logs but nothing will happen.

Seems to only happen on latest macOS 15.0 beta.

PRs with a fix would be welcome if there is a fix available for latest macOS 15.0
